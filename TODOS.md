 - layout visualization
 - I2C modular communication
 - Versioning system (keeping track of software versions on each module to prevent errors between different versions)
 - Better error handling (especially in the serial library)
 - Better audio system (sampling, buffering, loading samples from file, etc)
 - better synths (more waveforms, more complex envelopes, etc)
 - refactoring (seperate main function a bit, renaming the synth-related stuff, etc)
 - better documentation and comments
 - UI for customizing synths, and for changing the pitch of each note
 - UI for applying a calculated layout to the notes (instead of manually setting the pitch of each note)
 - Use new synth version for startup sound
